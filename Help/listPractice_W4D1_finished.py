#WEEK 4 DAY 1: LIST PRACTICE & REVIEW DEMO

#PROMPT: Write a program that reads the data file (below) and stores the data into lists.� then, process the lists to reprint the file data, record by record. Next, reprocess the lists to find each student's current average score along with the class average.� Store each student's average into a new list called 'avg' and reprint the records to include the average.� Reprocess the lists one more time to find the letter equivalent of the average and store this into a new list called 'let_avg'.� Reprint the lists for a third and final time, record by record including average score and average letter equivalent.� After this third print, print to the console the total number of student's in the class along with the class numeric average.��



#NOTES: 
#       *All averages should be rounded to the 2nd decimal place.
#       *Process List = for loop
#       * 'index' represents location within a list when processing through a for loop 
#       * average = sum_total / num_items
#       * 90 >= A ; 90 < B >= 80; 80 < C >= 70; 70 < D >= 60; 60 < F
#       * FILE SETUP:
#           FIELD0      FIELD1      FIELD2      FIELD3      FIELD4
#           FIRSTNAME   LASTNAME    TEST1       TEST2       TEST3
#       *once all processing of lists has taken place, the following should appear for each student
#       FIRSTNAME   LASTNAME    TEST1       TEST2       TEST3       NUM AVG     LETTER AVG


#VARIABLE DICTIONARY----------------------

#records        total records within the file, also total number of values in each list
#csvfile        shorthand name for file location, full file path
#file           firendly name for file data, after it has been passed through csv.reader()
#rec            LIST, an inidivudal record from the file; only used when connected to file
#first          LIST, first names of students ( rec[0] )
#last           LIST, last names of students ( rec[1] )
#test1          LIST, test 1 scores of students ( rec[2] )
#test2          LIST, test 2 scores of students ( rec[3] )
#test3          LIST, test 3 scores of students ( rec[4] )
#average        average sudents test score; average = (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3
#avg            LIST, numeric averages of each student
#letter         letter equivalent of student's average, requires an if/elif/elif/elif/else chain
#avg_let        LIST, letter averages of each student
#class_total    sum total of all numeric averages in the class
#class_average  class numeric average; class_average = class_total / records

        #store (append) file data into lists; since we are splitting one record's data into specific lists at a time, data is stored into separate lists *at the same point (position, index)* in each of the lists
